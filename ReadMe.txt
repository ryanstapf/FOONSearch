The main file is named search_Main.py

This file contains four different search algorithms. A standard Breadth-First Search, 
an Iterative Depth First Search, and two Greedy Breadth First Search algorithms with
heuristics based on motion node success rate and the fewest number of input objects.

Be sure to include the following files in the directory before running the code:

FOON_class.py
FOON.pkl
FOON.txt
kitchen.json
goal_nodes.json
motion.txt
preprocess.py
utensils.txt

This code outputs task trees by each algorithm for each goal node in goal_nodes.json
